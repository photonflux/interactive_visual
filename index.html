              <p>As the peaceful protests are gradually replaced by fighting the
              conflict becomes more and more a civil war. </p>
              Affected areas<br>

              <p>The sectarian dimension of the conflict has an increasing impact on displacement patterns.
              As widespread areas and whole towns turn into battlegrounds, more and more people are forced to flee to IDP camps all around Syria.</p>
