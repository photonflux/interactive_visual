        Shifting frontlines<br>
        <p>The continuing shift of frontlines between the government and opposition forces, and between the hundreds of radical jihadist groups and the secular opposition, turns more and more areas into battlegrounds and forces an increasing number of Syrians to flee. </p>

to make it worse Syrian authorities have not only failed to protect civilians from or during displacement, but is also deliberately targeting non-combatants and preventing international aid organisation from helping people in need.

            Phase 2: Break of the civil war
            <p>The second phase of the crisis starts in July 2012,
              when armed opposition groups go on the offensive against the Syrian army,
              leading to an intensification of fighting. </p>
              Flight reasons<br>
              <p>As the peaceful protests are gradually replaced by fighting the
              conflict becomes more and more a civil war. </p>
              Affected areas<br>
              <p> violence spreading on to the capital, Damascus and to Aleppo,
              the economic heart of the country and further urban areas.</p>
              Migration pattern<br>
              <p>The sectarian dimension of the conflict has an increasing impact on displacement patterns.
              As widespread areas and whole towns turn into battlegrounds, more and more people are forced to flee to IDP camps all around Syria.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="description" id="phase3">
              Phase 3: the sectarian dimension<br>
          <p> The third phase starts around March and April 2013.  Syrian army joins forces with Hezbollah and re-established government control over all areas bordering Lebanon. Perception of a Shiite alliance fighting radical Sunni groups is reinforced.  </p>
          Flight reasons<br> <p> The increasing number of extremist groups leads to an increase of sectarian violence against minorities such as Christians, Shiites, Druze, Yazidis and also Sunni civilians who do not submit to the socio-political vision of those extremist groups.   </p>
          Migration pattern<br>  <p>  The sectarian dimension of the conflict has an increasing impact on displacement patterns. As widespread areas and whole towns turn into battlegrounds, more and more people are forced to flee to IDP camps all around Syria. </p>
        </div>

          <div class="description" id="phase4">
          what next? <br>
          <p> Minorities seek safety from combat among their kinfolk.
          Such patterns of displacement contribute to disintegration of the country into sectarian enclaves and thus excludes the return of IDPs to previously mixed areas where their security would be at risk.</p>
          <p> Furthermore the lack of security, on-going high levels of violence and human rights violations of civilians in many parts of the country and massive destruction of housing and infrastructure are making the prospect of significant return of IDPs in the near future hypothetical.
